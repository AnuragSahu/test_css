                Miguel once said, “Isolation is the worst possible counselor”. Before understanding the effects of isolation, we must understand the story associated with different types of isolation. Have you ever thought about what the life of someone involved in a violent crime against humanity looks like? Well! The 9/11 attack led by Osama Bin Laden was one of the deadliest attacks in US history. Almost 3000 people were killed and countless got injured. The September 11 attack in 2001 made Laden one of the most wanted fugitives. In 2011 he was killed in a raid by the US forces. During these ten years, he lived in the city of Abbottabad located in Pakistan in complete isolation from the rest of the world. His family accompanied him in all these unfavorable conditions. Three of his sons were killed by the American forces, two of his wives had divorced him and one of his sons had even escaped and never met Osama again. His family depended on Osama’s two brothers for food and other necessities. His relationship with his brothers had faded into irritation & they felt an enormous amount of pressure and frustration to support Osama’s family. Laden and his family lived in a state of fear and isolation from the outside world. Several Doctors believed that he possibly had secondary osteoporosis which can lead to kidney diseases and an imbalance of insulin in the body. Later, it was discovered that he had received several insulin shots back in 1987 in Egypt. His physical condition would most likely have worsened without medical aid living in such isolated conditions.

                Mass shooters and several criminals go into a state of depression during their stay at Prison or while they are hiding or fleeing. Such people don’t have a sense of routine in their life. We tend to underestimate the importance of indulging in daily activities like going to work or school. These daily activities connect you with lots of new people and teach you new things. Imagine you had to stay home for 365 days. Apart from being monotonous and mundane, it's very frustrating and something that humans find very hard to cope with. We start believing things that people frequently tell us. Imagine no one telling you that you are kind, friendly, or honest? Would you have known that without somebody telling you that ever in your life?

                Depression can cause people to isolate themselves from their friends and family. People suffering from depression find it quite challenging to re-establish a new connection with the world once they are healthy. Isolation makes a person lose control and balance over their life. People tend to feel they are suffering in miserable ways and often become insensitive towards others.

                Older people living away from their children often experience loneliness. It invites many physical ailments like reduced efficiency of the immune system, lower sleep quality, hypertension, stress, and heart diseases. People who have lost their spouse or someone very dear to them are most likely at risk. Humans are social beings. One of the best things we can do for our loved ones is to remind them how much we care about them.
            </p>  <p>
                Isolation can also have a positive effect if done in the right way. A solo trip or hike in the mountains alone can make you feel positive and relaxed which improves your level of focus. There is a rejuvenating technique in Ayurveda, a holistic healing science which makes the patient live in a medicated house isolated from the world for some specified period. Then the patient is given potions extracted from herbs, made to follow a certain lifestyle, and allowed certain types of foods suiting the person’s body type. The patient isn't allowed to use any electronic gadget or meet anyone. After a month of this process, many patients found an increased level of energy and felt younger than before. Some people noticed their gray hair turning black again. This therapy has many positive effects on the overall physical and mental health of people experiencing it. Many places in South India provide this service to people under the supervision of licensed ayurvedic doctors. There is a positive side to everything including isolation.
