            I want you to remember the person who is your driving idol. It could be anybody, maybe it's your father or an uncle. Every time this person drives you feel that you are in safe hands. The drive feels like sitting on a sofa seat & enjoying the view. You want to master the art of driving just like them. The next time you guys spend time together watch how they drive. Think about the things you would like to be experts in, just like them. Make a list of some challenges for yourself to work on, it can be something like parallel parking without cameras, driving smoothly & patiently while in traffic, U-turns in narrow spaces, or perhaps smooth braking.
            </p><p>
            Most people think they are done learning to drive as soon as they pass their driving test. I’ve seen people driving like crazy as soon as they get their license. I remember I was once sitting in someone’s car & they hit the curb slightly then started suddenly accelerating & deaccelerating. I was watching them driving the whole time as I didn't trust their driving. Fortunately, it was just a 5 to 10-minute drive. Don't forget your passengers are your judges. Following the rules, driving with 0 alcohol, and not going over the speed limit not only saves your insurance but also gives the impression that you are a safe driver.
        </p><p>
            According to WHO around 1.3 million people are killed each year in road accidents. Driving accidents can take seconds to occur. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Don’t drive over speed just to avoid your manager's anger at work. It’s a good idea to take short breaks while driving for long hours while going on your weekend trip. Bring someone along who can drive when you are tired or need to sleep. It’s best to leave early in the morning so you can avoid the city traffic and enjoy your trip to the fullest. Make sure to get your car serviced by a trained auto mechanic after every few months & especially before long trips.
        </p><p>
            Avoid night driving when you can, fatal accidents have more chances of happening during night hours. It’s also straining for your eyes & needs more concentration power. In a situation where you can’t avoid driving at night make sure the passenger next to you isn't sleeping. You will start feeling sleepy just by watching them sleeping. You're sharing the road with other drivers, cyclists & motorcyclists while driving. Maintain some distance from drivers who don’t seem to be driving safely, and let them go if they seem to be in a hurry. Don’t start racing with people who try to overtake you just to try to show that you are a better driver. This not only distracts your focus from the road but also creates a dangerous environment for people around you.
        </p><p>
            While buying a new car make sure you are paying great attention to safety features. Some features like side and curtain airbags, blind spot warnings, tire pressure monitoring, anti-lock braking system with electronic brake force distribution can be an asset to have. I think it would be interesting to have a mobile-based application where you earn points for following the rules. Let’s say you are wearing your seatbelt you take a picture & upload it on your account. You get one point. Imagine asking your fellow passenger to make your video of driving as per the speed limit. After uploading it you earn 3 points. This live-time driving support system ranks you along with all other drivers in your state & country. You also get insurance discounts for the number of points you earned. This will motivate people to follow the rules resulting in lesser chances of accidents.
        </p><p>
            How would you feel if you were going to the office on your horse cart instead of a car? Horse carts caused 60 % fewer accidents than cars. We have the privilege to go in cars but it comes with a price. Don’t think you are just driving, think about your safety, the safety of the people sitting in your car & the ones on the road. You are not just a driver but the pilot of your car. Remember how responsible pilots are, as a result, aviation is one of the safest modes of transport in the world.
