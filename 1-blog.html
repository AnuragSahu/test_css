            Sher-E-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh </h2>
        </header>

        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            Maharaja Ranjit Singh was one of the legendary rulers of Asia he had a vast empire across the continent. The Sikh empire also called “Sarkar-E-Khalsa” was formed by Ranjit Singh. After the death of his father, Maharaja Ranjit Singh took charge of his father’s misl at the age of twelve years.Misl’s were different sikh groups , each sikh misl had its own Sardar leader.Sher-E-Punjab realised the need to unite all these misl’s to form a single united Kingdom.As a child he lost his left eye due to smallpox but he never let that prevent him from achieving great heights, instead he used to remark I see everyone with one eye, which meant all religions, castes, genders were equal in his eyes.

Once the Maharaja was travelling on his horse and accidentally a stone hit him. Children were trying to knock off some fruits from a nearby tree but instead the Maharaja was hit by a stone. The children feared that they would be punished by the angry Maharaja. To everyone’s surprise the Maharaja exclaimed “The stone would have provided berries from the tree. Now that the stone has hit me, I shall give gold coins in return”.

The people of his empire believed in “Hum Rakhat Patshahi Dawa” which translates as “We are the protectors of our King, there was a spirit of collective consciousness”. The Maharaja’s kingdom included present day Peshawar, Khyber, parts of western Tibet, Jammu Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Present Day Punjab of India & Pakistan and many more areas. After winning a battle, he never forced the opponent to beg him for mercy. He granted the defeated Ruler money, which was a calculated amount based on the salary, household & royal expenses. The Kohinoor Diamond which is currently a part of the Queen’s crown was once part of Sher-E-Punjab’s Treasure.

Every person was given the freedom of practising their own religion without any fear. In his 40-year rule, there were no rebellions and riots in his kingdom. He never announced death sentence to anyone during his rule.

The people who belonged to the Maharaja’s Kingdom had one of the highest literacy levels in Asia. A British Historian “G.W Leitner” remarks in his work that Punjab was the most educated place in the world during this Maharaja’s rule. In 1809 the Maharaja aimed to educate each citizen of Punjab & it was passed in the maharaja’s cabinet. Charles Metcalfe, a British officer was really impressed by the Maharaja’s Educational Policies. At that time a concept like Elementary Education didn’t even exist in Britain, it arrived there in 1870. In 1830 a large majority of the citizens were educated by this Maharaja including children, elderly, men and women. 

Every religious place in Punjab had a school attached to it, the Khalsa Darbar Lahore didn't approve the construction of any Temple, Mosque or Dharamshala until it had a school attached to it. Every village in Punjab through the Tehsildar (revenue officer) had the provision to provide “Qaida” which are books specifically designed to help people learn a language. These Qaida’s were made by intelligent scholars. These books enabled people to learn Gurmukhi, Farsi, Punjabi & Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji’s Teachings. The Person who received the Qaida had to hand write 5 more copies of the Qaida’s after reading & understanding it & send a handwritten letter to the Raj Darbar (The Maharaja’s Court). At that time there were no printing machines, this law ensured that there was a sufficient supply of Qaida’s. After writing 5 such Qaida’s the person mastered writing these languages along with reading & speaking. There were also some technical schools which taught skills & trades such as carpentry to people. Moral Education was the Foundation of Punjab’s Education System. Every village had a volunteer army which was trained in self-defence, they could even Challenge the Maharaja’s decision. The public was given a high authority by Sher-E-Punjab.

Punjab was an independent country until 1849.Capturing Punjab during the Maharaja’s Rule was next to impossible for the British Government. During British Colonization the literacy levels almost reduced to 50 %. After British rule Urdu & Hindi were introduced replacing Farsi & Gurmukhi which weakened the grip of people on their own languages. The East India Company tried it’s best to destroy Punjab’s Education System. A British Historian “Dr. Gottlieb William Leitner” was given this task to destroy this whole system of moral education. It took him almost 33 years to complete this task. The people of Punjab were paid money by the British government to hand over their armed weapons such as swords used for self-defence & Qaida’s. These educational books called Qaida’s were collected from every household in Punjab & later they were burnt by the government. The government quoted a high price of “6 annas” for every book they collected which was highest in comparison with weapons. Those Qaida’s were based on Guru Granth Sahib, which were a source of positivity for the citizens.

Even after decades of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s death he is still remembered and is an important figure to the people of Punjab. Today’s Punjabi Children might not know the name of the state’s ministers but I’m sure they have heard the name of “Maharaja Ranjit Singh”. Sher-E-Punjab has left traces of Punjabi culture in different parts of the world which might not be the part of Punjab today but imprints in the form of architecture, social reforms & Punjabi people still living there exist even today. Stories from the time of Sher-E-Punjab are still told through word of mouth in modern day Punjabi Households. This ruler had united Punjab which was divided into different Misl’s (form of sikh-groups), each Misl was extremely powerful and strong which was an extremely challenging task.

His traces can never be removed from the land of five rivers. The partition of India & Pakistan done by the British Government left a huge impact on Punjab. The line between these border’s separated so many loved one’s from each other in 1947. A Punjab province exists in India & Pakistan both, but it has resulted in separation of so many Punjabi families, monuments, cities, and Punjabi culture. Only 3 rivers Sutlej, Ravi, and Beas’s flow in today’s Punjab present in India, the other two rivers are in Pakistan’s Punjab.

The Maharaja’s throne, outfit & other accessories were taken away by the British Government and are kept in “Victor & Albert Museum” located in London. Taking away these possessions from Punjab has separated Punjabi’s from their roots. People of Punjabi Heritage deserve to have their historical and social icons respected. Punjabi Culture and values are incredibly different from what is depicted by musicians & actors. The ashes of this ruler are still preserved in a “marble urn “in a lotus like shape inside “Samadhi of Ranjit Singh” which is in present day Lahore of Pakistan.
